# Mellea workshop

This workshop will introduce the basics of Generative Computing through a series of labs following a use-case.

During this workshop, we will:
1. Get up an running with Mellea.
2. See the Instruct - Validate - Repair pattern in action.
3. Encapsulate LLM calls using a functional interface via Mellea's `@generative` decorator.
4. Combine Mellea and Docling to write a generative program that operates over documents.
5. Leverage a vision model to analyse an image.
